This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.



Week 1 

Lab Activity 1 - Intro

1.1 Open file:

```{r}
View(`mixo.simplified(1)`)
```


1.2 Show a summary:

```{r}
summary(`mixo.simplified(1)`)
```

1.3 Produce a scatterplot of Mass as predicted by SVL, and include a Linear Model:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(`mixo.simplified(1)`,aes(x=SVL,y=Mass))+ geom_point(shape=19) + geom_smooth(method="lm", se = FALSE) + ggtitle("Linear Model of Mass as predicted by SVL")
```

1.4 Produce plot with both Mass and SVL log transformed which should produce an approximately linear relationship 

```{r}
ggplot(`mixo.simplified(1)`,aes(x=log(SVL),y=log(Mass)))+ geom_point(shape=19) + geom_smooth(method="lm", se = FALSE) + ggtitle("Linear Log Model of Mass as predicted by SVL")
```

1.5 Modify plot in item 1.4 so data points are colour coded by Gender, but the linear model is kept the same (global - whole data set) 

```{r}
ggplot(`mixo.simplified(1)`,aes(x=log(SVL),y=log(Mass)))+ geom_point(aes(col=Gender)) + geom_smooth(method="lm", se = FALSE) + ggtitle("Linear Log Model of Mass as predicted by SVL and Gender")
```

1.6 Produce and plot separate models for each Gender using the col aesthetic as Gender again, but now globally in the ggplot() function

```{r}
ggplot(`mixo.simplified(1)`,aes(x=log(SVL),y=log(Mass),col=Gender))+ geom_point(shape=19) + geom_smooth(method="lm", se = FALSE) + ggtitle("Linear Log Model of Mass as predicted by SVL")
```

1.7 Produce a scatterplot of the length of the right tibia by SVL, grouped by Gender, and fit a separate linear model to each group

```{r}
ggplot(`mixo.simplified(1)`,aes(x=SVL,y=Righ.Tibia,col=Gender))+ geom_point(shape=19) + geom_smooth(method="lm", se = FALSE) + ggtitle("Linear Model of Right Tibia as predicted by SVL and Gender")
```


Lab Activity 2 - Text Ch 2.3

```{r}
x <- c(1,3,2)
x
y <- c(1,4,5)
length(x)
length(y)
x + y
ls()
```

matrix
```{r}
x=matrix(data=c(1,2,3,4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
x
```

further simplified matrix
```{r}
x=matrix(c(1,2,3,4), 2,2)
x
```

populate matrix by order of rows
```{r}
matrix(c(1,2,3,4), 2,2,byrow=TRUE)
```


```{r}
x=matrix(c(1,2,3,4), 2,2,byrow=TRUE)
sqrt(x)
x^2
```

generate vector of random variables
```{r}
x=rnorm(50)
y=x+rnorm(50,mean=50,sd=.1)
cor(x,y)
```

reproduce exact same set of random variables
```{r}
set.seed(1303)
rnorm(50)
```
